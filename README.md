# Orthogonal-Matching-Pursuit
This is a MATLAB implementation of orthogonal matching pursuit. We solve sparse recovery problem Ax=y where A is an m by N comlex valued matrix with N much larger than m. The algorithm takes in a measurement matrix A and measurement vector y and outputs an s-sparse vector x which solves Ax=y.
