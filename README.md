# Orthogonal Matching Pursuit
OMP.m is a MATLAB implementation of the orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm used for reconstructions of sparse vectors x from Ax=y. OMP adds one index to a target support set S and updates a target vector x as the vector supported on S that best fits the measurements. The algorithm takes as inputs a measurement matrix A and a measurement vector y and outputs a sparse vector x that solves Ax=y. OMPtesting.m tests the performance of the algorithm with varying number of rows and sparsity.
